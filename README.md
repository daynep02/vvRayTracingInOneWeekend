## Inspiration
During the final two weeks of my undergraduate computer graphics class, we were tasked with reading _Ray Tracing In One Weekend_, and were given the choice to 
follow the standard implementation in C++, or implement it in V, which we had been using for most of the class.

I chose to do it in V, but I did not use the language to its fullest extent. So over the christmas break, I decided to write it again, but using more of the features V has to offer.

## Possible Improvements

I could break each of the components out into their own modules. This would make it more "V like" (I think)?
